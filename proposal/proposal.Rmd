## 1. Introduction


## 2. Data

```{r load-data, message = FALSE}
titanic <- read.csv(here::here("data/titanic.csv"))

glimpse(titanic)
```



## 3. Data analysis plan
Hypothesis 1: Wemen have a higher survival rate than men. 
For question 1 we will create a new variable called "survival rate", using the "survived" column divided by the total number of different gender, as the response variable. We will also use "gender" as predictor variable. 

Hypothesis 2: The relationship between survival rate and age.
