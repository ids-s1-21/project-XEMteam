"Touted as the ultimate in transatlantic travel and said to be “unsinkable”, the Titanic collided with an iceberg on 14 April 1912 on her maiden voyage and sank shortly thereafter on 15 April, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew." [1]

### If and how the chance of survival of Titanic passengers is related to different attributes of the passengers

# Data set
* The data set comes from the Awesome Public Data Sets on GitHub[2]

* There are 12 variables and 891 observations in this data set. 
.pull-left[
- `Name`: Name and Surname of passenger, if available 
- `Survived`: If passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Sex`: Gender of passenger (male or female)
- `Age`: Age in years
- `Pclass`: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd) 
- `Fare`: Passenger fare (i.e. cost of ticket in USD)
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)[3] ]

# Gender and Survival

---

# Introduction
* During the times when the sinking of the Titanic accident occurred (1912), in the spirit of chivalry women (and children) were saved first. This was historically recorded as orders from the captain of the Titanic.

The class of the passenger can be considered to be a measure of their socio-economic status: based on our knowledge on the Titanic disaster we expect to find that the higher the class of the passenger, the higher their survival rate.

### Modelling Survival: Interpretation
Note: using main effects (vs. interactions) $\rightarrow$ results can still be interpreted with 3 explanatory variables.

```{r ref.label="titanic-fit-to-train-display", echo=FALSE}
```

**Coefficents** for *Class*: 
> All else held constant, second class passengers correspond to a negative coefficent which reflects a lower likelyhood of survival compared to first class passengers.

+ Similarly, third class passengers have an even more negative gradient which indicates that the model predicts them to have an even lower likelyhood of survival. 

**Coefficent** for *Gender*:
> All else held constant, male passengers correspond to a negative coefficent which reflects a lower likelyhood of survival compared to female passengers.

**Coefficents** for *Age*: 
> All else held constant, compared to passengers aged 0-6 ('young children'), passengers in age range from 6 to 18 ('adolescents')are expected to be less likely to survive. 

+ similarly, passengers aged 18 to 54 ('adults') are also less likely to survive (similar gradeint to 6-18)
+ passengers aged 54 to 80 ('elderly people') are even less likely to survive than the other age ranges

.pull-left[
Brath (2018) created mosaic plots filling the tiles with the names of the victims and survivors among the 1308 passengers. 

> This highlights the fact that the passengers were people, not statistics. It's common to overlook on this while handling data that has to do with casualties.

* This is also an example of how typography could be used in data visualization.
