"Touted as the ultimate in transatlantic travel and said to be “unsinkable”, the Titanic collided with an iceberg on 14 April 1912 on her maiden voyage and sank shortly thereafter on 15 April, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew." [1]

We want to see 

### If and how the chance of survival of Titanic passengers is related to different attributes of the passengers 

---
# Data set
* The data set comes from the Awesome Public Data Sets on GitHub[2]

* There are 12 variables and 891 observations in this data set. 
--
- `Name`: Name and Surname of passenger, if available 
- `Survived`: If passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Sex`: Gender of passenger (male or female)
- `Age`: Age in years
- `Pclass`: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd) 
- `Fare`: Passenger fare (i.e. cost of ticket in USD)
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)[3]

# Gender and Survival

---

# Introduction
* During the times when the sinking of the Titanic accident occurred (1912), in the spirit of chivalry women (and children) were saved first. This was historically recorded as orders from the captain of the Titanic.
--



* Women have higher survival rate than men.

### Aim of the model 

+ 
fitting a binary logistic regression machine learning model using tidymodels library
testing the trained model’s prediction (model evaluation) strength on the unseen/test data set using various evaluation metrics.
+ parsimonious model (*Occam's razor*)

---
### Modelling Survival
+ **predictor/explanatory variables**:
  + Age
  + Passenger class
  + Gender
+ **ID variable**: passenger ID
+ **response variable**: survival
  + categorical, two levels ...

### Modelling Survival: Interpretation
Note: using main effects (vs. interactions) $\rightarrow$ results can still be interpreted with 3 explanatory variables.  
**Intercept**: 
> Positive intercept for baseline (i.e. female, first class passenger, aged 0-6) is expected to survive.

Negative **Coefficents** for a term:
> All else held constant, a negative coefficient reflects a lower likelyhood of survival compared to the corresponding baseline variable. 

**Class**: 1st class $\rightarrow$ 2nd class $\rightarrow$ 3rd class

**Sex**: female $\rightarrow$ male

**Age**: children (0-6) $\rightarrow$ teenagers/ adults (6-18 and 18-54) $\rightarrow$ elderly (54 - 80)

## Aside

.pull-left[
Brath (2018) created mosaic plots filling the tiles with the names of the victims and survivors among the 1308 passengers. 

> This highlights the fact that the passengers were people, not statistics. It's common to overlook on this while handling data that has to do with casualties.
