# Research Aim 

 
### Is the chance of survival of Titanic passengers related to different attributes of the passengers? If so, how?
 
---
# Data set
* The data set comes from the Awesome Public Data Sets on GitHub[2]
 
* There are 12 variables and 891 observations in this data set. 
--
.left[
- `Name`: Name and Surname of passenger, if available 
- `Survived`: If passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Sex`: Gender of passenger (male or female)
- `Age`: Age in years
- `Pclass`: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd) 
- `Fare`: Passenger fare (i.e. cost of ticket in USD)
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)[3] ]

# Is Age related to Passenger's Survival Rate ?

+ Age is considered a major factor of survival 
  + physical abilities of a passenger 
  + prioritizing life saving equipment

Age is considered a major factor of survival when it comes to physical abilities of a passenger as well as prioritizing  life saving equipment

## Is Gender related to Passenger's Survival Rate ?
 
---
**NOTE:** this is historical data and the gender of passengers is defined as binary

--

+ During the times when the sinking of the Titanic accident occurred (1912), in the spirit of chivalry women (and children) were saved first. 
  
  + This was historically recorded as orders from the captain of the Titanic.

  + Expect women to have higher survival rate than men.

### Aim of the model 

+ 
fitting a binary logistic regression machine learning model using tidymodels library
testing the trained model’s prediction (model evaluation) strength on the unseen/test data set using various evaluation metrics.
+ parsimonious model (*Occam's razor*)

---
### Modelling Survival
+ **predictor/explanatory variables**:
  + Age
  + Passenger class
  + Gender
+ **ID variable**: passenger ID
+ **response variable**: survival
  + categorical, two levels ...

Negative **Coefficents** for a term:
> All else held constant, a negative coefficient reflects a lower likelyhood of survival compared to the corresponding baseline variable. 

**Class**: 1st class $\rightarrow$ 2nd class $\rightarrow$ 3rd class

**Sex**: female $\rightarrow$ male

**Age**: children (0-6) $\rightarrow$ teenagers/ adults (6-18 and 18-54) $\rightarrow$ elderly (54 - 80)

Produces high score if the prediction obtained good results in TP, FN, TN, FP, proportionally to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset. (here moderate agreement)

## Aside

.pull-left[
Brath (2018) created mosaic plots filling the tiles with the names of the victims and survivors among the 1308 passengers. 

> This highlights the fact that the passengers were people, not statistics. It's common to overlook on this while handling data that has to do with casualties.

* This is also an example of how typography could be used in data visualization.
