#Background information 

"Touted as the ultimate in transatlantic travel and said to be “unsinkable”, the Titanic collided with an iceberg on 14 April 1912 on her maiden voyage and sank shortly thereafter on 15 April, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew." [1]

We want to see 
####If and how the chance of survival of Titanic passengers is related to different attributes of the passengers

# Introduction to data set
* The data set comes from the Awesome Public Data Sets on GitHub[2]

* There are 12 variables and 891 observations in this data set. 
.pull-left[
- `Name`: Name and Surname of passanger, if available 
- `Survived`: If passenger survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
- `Sex`: Gender of passanger (male or female)
- `Age`: Age in years
- `Pclass`: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd) 
- `Fare`: Passenger fare (i.e. cost of ticket in USD)
- `Embarked`: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)[3] ]

# Hypothesis 1: Women have a higher survival rate than men

# Introduction
* During the times when the sinking of the Titanic accident occurred (1912), in the spirit of chivalry women (and children) were saved first. This was historically recorded as orders from the captain of the Titanic.

# Hypothesis 2: The younger survivals are more than the older survivals 
---
The age of a passenger can be considered to be high priority. We take it for granted that people give priority to saving infants and young child when it comes to providing life saving equipment. Beyond that the survival of passengers is highly related to their physical abilities which means that the younger the passenger is the higher possibility is to survive.

- Use "Age" as the predictor variable(X) and "Frequency" as the outcome variable(Y) displayed in terms of colors showing survivals or not.
- Create a a new variable called "Age_Range" which groups the ages by scale of 10 so that we can find the survival rate for each age range and come outwith more concrete conclusions.

# Embarked/Class/Fare 

The class of the passenger can be considered to be a measure of their socio-economic status: based on our knowledge on the Titanic disaster we expect to find that the higher the class of the passenger, the higher their survival rate.```{r class-survived ,echo=FALSE}
titanic$Survived <- as.factor(titanic$Survived)
titanic$Pclass <- as.factor(titanic$Pclass) 

titanic_class <- titanic %>%
  group_by( Pclass ) %>%
 count(Survived) %>%
 mutate(pct = n/sum(n) * 100)

titanic_class %>%
ggplot(aes(x=Pclass , y = pct ,  fill = Survived)) +
  geom_bar( position = position_stack(), stat = "identity", width = .7 ) +
  geom_text(aes(y = pct, label = pct) ,position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), size = 3.5 )

## Aside

.pull-left[
Brath (2018) created mosaic plots filling the tiles with the names of the victims and survivors among the 1308 passengers. 

> This highlights the fact that the passengers were people, not statistics. It's common to overlook on this while handling data that has to do with casualties.

* This is also an example of how typography could be used in data visualization.
